## Creating functions specific to employees
### Write a function isDirector:
    - it accepts employee as an argument
    - it will be used as a type predicate and if the employee is a director

### Write a function executeWork:
    - it accepts employee as an argument
    - if the employee is a Director, it will call workDirectorTasks
    - if the employee is a Teacher, it will call workTeacherTasks

### Expected result:
```
executeWork(createEmployee(200));
Getting to work
executeWork(createEmployee(1000));
Getting to director tasks
```
